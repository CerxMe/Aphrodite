        | Using the preset that we had on the Arenia server, we started a new world. The sky islands were magnificent, but the shadows they produced beneath were a nightmare for early game. We spawned in a plains biome next to the ocean and a birch forest, and reserved that big open space for an iron farm that I eventually built before we learned it kept breaking. It still provided iron for the whole server until we needed more, when we (@Tommin ) started an iron titan. In the spaces around spawn towards the end you started making a massive scale carpet duper to fuel a furnace array, a cobblestone generator that used duped TNT to break the cobble, and a super lag inducing smooth stone generator with a haste 2 beacon to mine smooth stone. Spawn chunks were a mess.

        | However, not many player builds were in spawn chunks, we mostly built in Nilsson town, named by Torayu and JON I believe. We had no organisation and I think it looked pretty cool. We had Cerx's Granary with 100% automatic wheat and chicken, JON's skyscraper foundations on top of the mountain, the original Enchanted Forest that got burned down, Tommin's corner of 'the base that did it all', the Death Games, some houses, and more. My absolute favourite part, was that if you walked further east along the coast you would follow this main path past quite a few player bases, including @MegaSuperReye 's base on a hill. Continue further east and you cross the big bridge, bringing you towards the end of the continent where I think @Anubis 's half-dug hole was. Right next to him was my castle made of iron blocks, and the small village and docks around it.
        | The third and final area on Season 1 was not used too much before we reset, which was a shame. Tusk Valley was the best shopping district I think I've ever seen in Minecraft, and took weeks of several people working (I think it was Cerx, Wylker and.. Atlas? Maybe someone else) to lay out the plots and paths. It was located north by north-east of Nilsson Town and was secluded in some crazy extreme hills. We had hot air balloons in the air, access to the ocean, and plenty of cliffs and overhangs that we put shops up on.
        |  Of course, all of this would have been hard to navigate around if it weren't for @Tommin 's octagonal nether hub. It got messy with intersecting tunnels and a point near the end of the server it was EerieP that designed a really cool and majestic new nether hub with ice theme.
